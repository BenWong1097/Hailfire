	Standard for serial comm.	In progress




Target loop speed is *at least* 100Hz, so at most 10ms per cycle. Motor interaction eats 
2ms out of that, and the Gyro/accelerometer eats another 2.5ms.

That leaves 5.5ms for the controller and interface. It is in theory possible to allow for 
controller calculations to happen while the motor controller does its job, but that makes for
icky code, so I'll only do that if absolutely necessary. The MPU6050 interaction is more
complicated, but there is also room to speed things up, namely by replacing trig functions
used in the library with fast approximations (.5ms speed up), and by replacing the builtin
Wire implementation with Fastwire (unknown speed up).
